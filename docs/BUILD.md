# Build Guide

We use semantic versions for Nuvolaris releases.

Releases are in form `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, for example `0.1.2`

Pre-releases are in form `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-MILESTONE.DATETAG`

where the `DATETAG` is generated by the command `date +%y%m%d%H`, for example `0.2.0-trinity.22030816`

## Artifact

The following artifacts are part of Nuvolaris:

- the `nuv` CLI, a multiplatform binary written in go. The stable releases are published as Releases in the `github.com/nuvolaris/nuvolaris` repository, while pre-releases and snapshots are in  `github.com/nuvolaris/nuvolaris-cli` 

- the docker images are published as packages of `ghcr.io/nuvolaris`, and they are, currently:

  - `nuvolaris-devkit`, used for the development environment
  - `nuvolaris-operator`, the Kubernetes operator that installs and manages OpenWhisk
  - `openwhisk-standalone`, the actual OpenWhisk, built as a single node controller+invoker executable

Currently, the `nuvolaris-devkit` is the development environment that VSCode starts when it opens the source tree. The `nuv` cli deploys in Kubernetes the `nuvolaris-operator` and  downloads and installs the other images, currently only the `openwhisk-standalone`.  

Note that are other images, such as CouchDB and the openwhisk runtimes, are downloaded from Docker Hub. In future, we will build and provide our image.

## GitHub actions

There are 3 workflows in GitHub actions in the various repos with those names:

- `check` is activated by every push, and only checks licenses
- `image` is activated by any tag starting with a number, and builds and pushes an image in the `ghcr.io/nuvolaris` registry 
- `release` is activated by any tag starting with `v` and releases a go binary.

## Building `nuv`

The repo containers source code of `nuv` is `github.com/nuvolaris/nuvolaris-cli` (here referred as `upstream`)

To build a new pre-release, generate a tag with `task tag` (that generates one tag in format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-MILESTONE.DATETAG`) and then `git push upstream --tags`.

When you want a stable release tag manually as `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (note that `v` distinguishes the build of a binary from the build of an image, that always starts with a number).

This will build the artifact in `nuvolaris-cli`. To actually rebuild the artifact in the main nuvolaris repo, just push the same tag in the `nuvolaris/nuvolaris` repo 

## Building images

- to build the `nuvolaris-devkit` image, create a tag **starting with a number** in the `nuvolaris/nuvolaris` repo and push it.

- to build the `openwhisk-operator` image, create a tag **starting with a number** in the `nuvolaris/nuvolaris-controller` repo and push it.

- to build the `openwhisk-standalone` image, create a tag **starting with a number** in the `nuvolaris/nuvolaris-controller` repo and push it.
